# sax robot

saxrobot/saxbot is a novelty IRC bot who matches any mention of the string "sax"
in any part of an IRC message in the channels it monitors, with as many
saxaphone icons (ðŸŽ·) as there were instances of "sax" throughout each message.

## Example:

	<someuser> sax
	<somesaxbot> ðŸŽ· 
	<someuser> saxaphone woosaxSAXalright
	<somesaxbot> ðŸŽ· ðŸŽ· ðŸŽ· 

Simple eh.
